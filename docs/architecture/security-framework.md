# Enterprise Security Framework

**Author:** Arthur Schwan  
**Last Updated:** September 11, 2025  
**Status:** Architecture Design Phase

## üéØ Overview

Enterprise-grade security framework for the AI Code Agent platform, designed to meet IBM and Microsoft enterprise security standards.

## üîê Security Architecture

### Authentication & Authorization
- **OIDC/OAuth2** - Single Sign-On integration with enterprise identity providers
- **RBAC** - Role-Based Access Control with granular permissions
- **JWT Tokens** - Secure token-based authentication with refresh mechanisms
- **Multi-Factor Authentication** - Support for enterprise MFA requirements

### Audit & Compliance
- **Audit Trails** - Comprehensive logging of all user actions and system events
- **Data Lineage** - Complete tracking of data flow through the system
- **Model Governance** - AI model versioning, approval workflows, and usage tracking
- **Compliance Reporting** - Automated generation of GDPR, SOX compliance reports

### Network Security
- **Zero Trust Architecture** - Never trust, always verify approach
- **mTLS** - Mutual TLS for service-to-service communication
- **Network Segmentation** - Isolated network zones for different security levels
- **API Security** - Rate limiting, input validation, and API gateway protection

### Secrets Management
- **HashiCorp Vault** - Centralized secrets management
- **Key Rotation** - Automated rotation of encryption keys and certificates
- **Encryption at Rest** - All data encrypted using AES-256
- **Encryption in Transit** - TLS 1.3 for all network communication

## üèóÔ∏è Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Foundation (Q1 2026)
- OIDC integration with Azure AD / LDAP
