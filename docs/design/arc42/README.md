9. **Architecture Decisions** - Important decisions and their rationale
10. **Quality Requirements** - Performance, security, reliability requirements
11. **Risks and Technical Debt** - Known risks and technical debt
12. **Glossary** - Important domain and technical terms

### üîó Current Architecture Resources

Until this arc42 documentation is complete, please refer to:

- **[C4 Architecture Diagrams](../architecture.html)** - Visual system overview
- **[Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)](../adr/)** - Key technical decisions
- **[Project Goals & Vision](../goal.md)** - Strategic objectives
- **[System README](../../README.md)** - Technical implementation details

### üìù Contributing

This documentation is being developed incrementally. Each section will be filled with detailed technical information about the AI Code Agent system architecture.
